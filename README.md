## Description

In this health data project, I've analyzed a dataset from the FDA Orange Book, a database published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which provides information on:

- **Approved Prescription Drugs** – Lists drugs that have been approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy.
- **Therapeutic Equivalence (TE) Codes** – Indicates whether a generic drug is considered therapeutically equivalent to its brand-name counterpart.
- **Patent and Exclusivity Information** – Shows the patent expiration dates and market exclusivity periods for drugs.
- **New Drug Applications (NDA) & Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA)** – Contains details on both innovator drugs (NDA) and generics (ANDA).

Why is the Orange Book important?

- Helps pharmacies and healthcare providers determine if a generic drug can be safely substituted for a brand-name drug.
- Guides generic drug manufacturers on when they can enter the market based on patent and exclusivity expiration
- Assists regulators and researchers in tracking drug approvals and competition in the pharmaceutical industry.
